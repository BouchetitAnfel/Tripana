# Tripana  Website
This is Tripana, my first take at a responsive HTML website to show off workshops and travel adventures in Spain. I’ve focused on making it clean, and easy to navigate. 
Right now, I’ve done one workshop page for a Pottery Workshop, with all the essentials: title, description, date, and location.

# Why Tripana?
I named it Tripana because it’s catchy, fun, and gives off adventure vibes. It’s like “trip” + something unique and Spanish.

# The Logo & Font
The logo uses Cinzel Decorative, this font is special and classic, but still playful. I picked it because:
 - It makes Tripana stand out
 - Feels creative and cultural, which matches the workshops vibe
 - Easy to say
 - Pairs nicely with clean fonts like Montserrat for the rest of the site

### Core Pages
- **Homepage** - Hero section with smooth carousel showcasing Spanish destinations, feature grid highlighting platform capabilities
- **Services Page** - Comprehensive overview of workshops, custom itineraries, local partnerships, and cultural immersion programs
- **Workshop Pages** - Detailed workshop templates (Pottery, Cooking, Flamenco, Architecture tours) with booking information
- **About Us** - Company story, mission, core values, team profiles, and impact statistics
- **Blog** - Featured articles, filterable post grid, newsletter signup

# Design & Layout Choices
1) - Colors
I went for warm, earthy tones inspired by Spanish pottery and landscapes:
#e8e3db – soft beige background for a friendly vibe
#8b7355 / #a68a6a – warm gradients on cards for depth and style
#5a6e52 / #7a8e72 – green accents to balance the warm tones
#000 / #c5a87a – buttons and text for contrast
The goal? Make it elegant, welcoming, and a little artsy.

## Design Elements
- Frosted glass card effects (`rgba` backgrounds with blur)
- Rounded corners (20-50px border-radius) for modern aesthetic
- Subtle shadows and hover animations for depth
- Gradient backgrounds and overlays
- Geometric icons replacing emojis for professional look
- Consistent spacing and typography hierarchy

# Typography & Layout
Cinzel Decorative for the logo : bold, unique
Montserrat for everything else : modern, clean, readable
Layout is modular and responsive: hero section, carousel, feature grids, and workshop pages all flow nicely

 - Added hover effects, subtle animations, and gradients to make it interactive and alive

### User Experience
- **Authentication System** - Clean sign-in/sign-up pages with Google and Facebook login integration
- **User Dashboard** - Personalized dashboard showing upcoming bookings, completed tours, statistics, and recommendations
- **Profile Management** - Comprehensive profile page with personal information, account details, and travel preferences
- **Interactive Elements** - Password toggles, form validation, smooth page transitions via JavaScript
