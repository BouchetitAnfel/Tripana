# Tripana  Website
This is Tripana, my first take at a responsive HTML website to show off workshops and travel adventures in Spain. I’ve focused on making it clean, and easy to navigate. 
Right now, I’ve done one workshop page for a Pottery Workshop, with all the essentials: title, description, date, and location.

# Why Tripana?
I named it Tripana because it’s catchy, fun, and gives off adventure vibes. It’s like “trip” + something unique and Spanish.

# The Logo & Font
The logo uses Cinzel Decorative, this font is special and classic, but still playful. I picked it because:
 - It makes Tripana stand out
 - Feels creative and cultural, which matches the workshops vibe
 - Easy to say
 - Pairs nicely with clean fonts like Montserrat for the rest of the site

# Pages I Built
 - Homepage :  Introduces Tripana, has a big hero section with an image, a short intro, and smooth navigation.
 - Pottery Workshop Page : This is the first workshop I added,
Shows the title, description, date, and location
 - Features Page : Showcasing platform capabilities (trip planning, booking, maps, collaboration tools)
 - Contact Page : Full contact form with email, phone, location info and social media links
 - Pricing Page : Three-tier pricing (Explorer/Free, Adventurer/€19, Connoisseur/€49) with monthly/annual toggle and FAQ section
 - About Us Page : Company story, core values, team section with 4 members, mission statement, and stats (12K+ travelers, 200+ partners)
 - Blog Page : Featured article layout, filterable blog posts grid, newsletter signup section


# Design & Layout Choices
1) - Colors
I went for warm, earthy tones inspired by Spanish pottery and landscapes:
#e8e3db – soft beige background for a friendly vibe
#8b7355 / #a68a6a – warm gradients on cards for depth and style
#5a6e52 / #7a8e72 – green accents to balance the warm tones
#000 / #c5a87a – buttons and text for contrast
The goal? Make it elegant, welcoming, and a little artsy.

# Typography & Layout
Cinzel Decorative for the logo : bold, unique
Montserrat for everything else : modern, clean, readable
Layout is modular and responsive: hero section, carousel, feature grids, and workshop pages all flow nicely

 - Added hover effects, subtle animations, and gradients to make it interactive and alive

# Notes
First draft, so only the Pottery Workshop is up for now
Navigation works smoothly between homepage and workshop page
Focused on modern, aesthetic, and user-friendly design

**//Updated:**
After many drafts and many to come i added Major expansion Added multiple core pages.
